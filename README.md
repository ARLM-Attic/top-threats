# top-threats

The OBPP Top Threats Project lists the most prominent threats to Bitcoin user
 privacy. This is a resource for developers, users, and educators to identify
 weaknesses in software and products, and to guide their future remediation.

The **OBPP Top 3 for 2016** is the first and most recent edition this project.
 The project is currently in **private review**. When this phase ends, the
 project will enter a public review phase, when we will place the latest
