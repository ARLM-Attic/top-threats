##  Pull Requests

Please fork a copy to your own username or organization, and create a
 feature branch with the changes you want to make. Submit your pull
 request to OBPP's master branch.

## Writing

Because this repository will be mostly or all text, it's important that you
 review your submission for spelling and grammatical errors. The style of your
 submission should match the style of the existing text. A simple trick to
 review spelling and grammar is to copy your text and paste it into a temporary
 Google Drive document, and run the spell-check function; you can also use your
 favorite word processing application for this.

## Git Flow

We're using a KISS approach; master branch will always be the definitive version
 of the project. Contributors will use the pull request instructions above. When
 major milestones are hit, we may tag some versions of the master branch as
 releases.
